# CNN based Traffic Sign Classification 

We shall be using CNN networks tp train and classify traffic signs. We shall be doing this using OpenCV in real time using webcam. 


The Data set can be downloaded from : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AZeKw90Cb6GgamTBO3mvDdz6PjBwqCC
It contains Train traffic signs with over 35000 images of 43 different classes.

We shall be using keras and tensorflow libraries

<h1><b> Implementation of Code </h1></b>

1. Download and extract the dataset
2. In the same directory clone the Main_model_train.py code ``` $ python Main_model_train.py ``` 
3. The code will output the trained weights as "model_trained.p"
4. ``` $ python Tester_code_Webcam.py ``` 
It will load the trained model and start the detection

<h1><b> Results </h1></b>
